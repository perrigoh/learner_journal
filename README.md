# Learner's Journal

The journey of learning computer science from scratch can be quite bumpy. There are numerous tools and commands to learn and the commands might be slightly different between operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows etc.). As the learning goes on, there are high tendencies of forgetting what was learned earlier or getting confused about the command used for which tool. Hence, this Learner's Journal is created to have a quick reference on the commonly used commands of the tools that the author learned or tried with her computer's software environment.  

> Note: The commands are mainly workable for the following software environment:  
>
> * Operating system: Windows 11 Home
> * Source code editor: Visual Studio Code 1.73.0
> * Terminal : Git Bash 4.4.23(1)-release run in Visual Studio Code
> * Python: 3.9.13
