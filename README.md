# Learner's Journal

The journey of learning about AI from scratch can be quite bumpy. It starts with learning various programming languages,
acquiring knowledge to work with data, understanding machine learning and building user interfaces.

With this much to learn, the ability to retain what was learned in the early stage will probably get lost somewhere. 
Hence, this Learner's Journal was born to document some references and provide guides for future use.
